# Classifying CAPTHA images - with and without neural networks
In this project, I have classified numbers which that in CAPTHA images two classifiers: partly an algorithm I built myself and, partly a custom deisgned shallow convolutional neural network (CNN).

The data used are simplified CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) images, which you probably have seen on websites where you have to prove that you are not a robot, where the task is to classify the numbers 0, 1 and 2 in each image.
